# Summary
Continue to build out Web3 ready applications using IPFS/SWARM content storage providers, ETHEREUM/POLKADOT blockchains using bridges like SUBSTRATE and oracles like Chainlink to communicate via Web3API.

# Roadmap
Continued involvement with all things Web3API related, this includes providing Tech, Ops and Content contributions. Currently looking into the codebase as well as understanding the DAO workflow is the next action items.  Moving an existing platform of already deployed smart contracts from OpenLaw and other sources towards a Web3API schema should ensure that there are enough mini-applications in the Web3API Hub.
