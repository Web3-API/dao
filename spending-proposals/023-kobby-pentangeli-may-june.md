# Kobby Pentangeli - May + June

| Funds Requested | Time Period | Estimated Effort | Effective Rate |
|-|-|-|-|
| $16,900 + 15.6`W3API` | May 17th - June 30th | 260 hrs (40/wk) | $65/hr + 0.06`W3API`/hr |

## Summary

Implement support for Rust-based Web3APIs. This will entail implementing:
- Rust WASM runtime, including: 
    - Web3API WASM Standard Imports/Exports
    - MsgPack
    - etc.
- Rust bindings for the Web3API schema.
- Rust build environment.

I'll be working directly with @dOrgJelli, making sure the implementation is compatible w/ existing AssemblyScript support.
