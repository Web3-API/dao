## Summary

This is a proposal for Web3Hub development, in which we will design and build out the interface according to the Product Roadmap document seen [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s8ZJaJZRfDYqjUFRXcB4egwrZQHIUqod9JhIws1g77Q/edit?usp=sharing).

The team composition will be the following:
