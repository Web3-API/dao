## Summary

This is the main proposal for Web3Hub development, in which we will design and build out the interface according to the Product Roadmap document seen [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s8ZJaJZRfDYqjUFRXcB4egwrZQHIUqod9JhIws1g77Q/edit?usp=sharing)

The team composition will be the following for February:
- FT Engineer (Jeff)
- PT Designer (Marko)
- PT PM (Andrew)

Project management will be facilitated through Linear, day-to-day conversations will happen on the Web3API discord, and Andrew will lead the weekly sync meetings to give updates on overall project progress.


## Deliverables

A dedicated GitHub repo will be created for the Web3Hub and features will be committed and merged there as they are completed. The high-level goals for February are:
- Complete front-end scaffolding and state management setup
- Complete basic, static, un-styled versions of Browse, View API, and Create API views
- Complete 50% of UI design work needed
