## Frangs Proposal

I would like to help in the community part with:

- Answer the questions that people have and be always active
- Discourse forum
- Create memes, gifs etc.
- Organize challenges

And whatever it takes to help the community, basically being a community manager. :D

# Plan 1 to grow the community

We can do a contest on Discord that is "Describe Polywrap in one sentence" and the 3 most creative win a prize, examples: "Polywrap is so effective and easy that you can use it with any programming language"

# Plan 2

Meme contest with some dynamics, example:
