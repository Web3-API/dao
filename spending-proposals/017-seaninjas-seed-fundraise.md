# SeaNinjas Fundraise preparation


| Funds Requested | Time Period |
|-|-|
| $0 + 100 `W3API` | Apr 20, 2021 - May 20, 2021 | 

## **Summary**

We are proposing to initiate prepation for the next cycle of Web3APIs fundraise. The pre-seed raise in December was highly successful, and the Web3API DAO has used the funds to steward its development via bringing on world class engineers, launch partners, and operations. In order to accelerate the development of the Web3API ecosystem, we would like to prepare to maximize the chances of securing another round of financing with excellent strategic backers, followed by a token generation event. SeaNinjas proposes to lead this process with its years of financial expertise.

## **Detailed Deliverables**

- Rebranded Website: Develop story to optimize portrayal of value proposition through a rebranded website. Our team will work with Web3API team members to execute on our proposal. The rebranded website will enhance Web3API’s ability to attract major customers, industry-leading talent, and world-class backers. As part of this proposal, our team will also recommend a new name to enhance the product’s branding and ecosystem positioning.
- Pitch Deck: The Web3API pre-seed pitch deck drove a successful fundraise in late 2020. Since then, there have been many product developments, customer wins, and strategy iterations. We plan to capture all these exciting developments in a concise story, in addition to exhibiting the market opportunity available for Web3API. We will draw on experiences with successful pitches across venture backed companies and successful protocols to materially increase the valuation during this fundraise.
- Advise on Valuation: Our team will draw on financial valuation expertise to propose a fair valuation based on comparable tokens and business models from successful venture backed companies and projects.
- Legal Entity formed: Our team will work with lawyers to form an optimal legal entity for the Web3API DAO and its future ambitions.
