# SeaNinjas Capital Raise and Liqduitity Creation Proposal


| Funds Requested | Time Period |
|-|-|
| $0 + 600 `W3API` | Apr 1, 2021 - Dec 31, 2021 | 

## **Summary**

We are proposing to initiate a plan for the next year of Web3APIs fundraise. The pre-seed raise in December was highly successful, and the Web3API DAO has used the funds to steward its development via bringing on world class engineers, launch partners, and operations. In order to accelerate the development of the Web3API ecosystem, we would like to secure another round of financing with excellent strategic backers, followed by a token generation event. SeaNinjas proposes to lead this process with its years of financial expertise.

## **Detailed Deliverables**

**Milestone 1:**

- Rebranded Website: Develop story to optimize portrayal of value proposition through a rebranded website. Our team will work with Web3API team members to execute on our proposal. The rebranded website will enhance Web3API’s ability to attract major customers, industry-leading talent, and world-class backers. As part of this proposal, our team will also recommend a new name to enhance the product’s branding and ecosystem positioning.
- Pitch Deck: The Web3API pre-seed pitch deck drove a successful fundraise in late 2020. Since then, there have been many product developments, customer wins, and strategy iterations. We plan to capture all these exciting developments in a concise story, in addition to exhibiting the market opportunity available for Web3API. We will draw on experiences with successful pitches across venture backed companies and successful protocols to materially increase the valuation during this fundraise.
- Advise on Valuation: Our team will draw on financial valuation expertise to propose a fair valuation based on comparable tokens and business models from successful venture backed companies and projects.
- Legal Entity formed: Our team will work with lawyers to form an optimal legal entity for the Web3API DAO and its future ambitions.

**Milestone 2:**

- Financial Backer Outreach: Our team will identify a target list of top tier financial backers that we believe would be valuable members of the Web3API cap table. We will manage outreach to and communications with these financial backers, and this will be documented through a CRM that our team will construct.
- PR Timeline and Strategy: Our team will recommend a timeline and outreach strategy for Web3API to manage communications in a manner that optimize customer wins, fundraise valuation, and token generation event success.
- Propose timeline for token generation and strategy: We propose the Web3API DAO to target a private fundraise in June 2021 with a TGE coming in September 2021. Our team will develop novel mechanisms for community engagement, including but not limited to airdrops, liquidity bootstrapping pools, and liquidity mining.
- Advise on the selection of a group of backers: The choice of backers can make or break an organization at our stage. We will select backers who will not only provide patient capital to see through Web3API's mission (any protocol, any language), but also have a track record in  providing strategic support and have taken web3 projects to mass adoption.

## **Fund Distribution**

We propose to distribute the funds in accordance with milestones:
