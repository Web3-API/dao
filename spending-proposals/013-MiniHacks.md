## Spending Proposal 
# 013-Web3API_MiniHacks

| Funds Requested | Time Period | Estimated Effort | Effective Rate |
|-|-|-|-|
| 20 `W3API` | Monthly (Recurring) | N/A | N/A |

## Summary

To incentivize all members of the ecosystem to experiment and create new ideas in a permisionless way, each month the Web3API DAO will host a mini-hackathon where the best projects will be selected by other members of the DAO, and a reward pool of W3API tokens will be shared pro-rata to all participants who received votes.

## Detailed Deliverables

We'll host a permissionless, low-maintenance minihackathon each month. These rewards will be "airdropped" to the participants after each round's vote has concluded.

## Fund Distribution

The tokens will be distributed pro-rata, as rewards to the participants of each hackathon, according to the results of the votes on all of the submissions.

Address(es) and distribution of funds will vary each month.
