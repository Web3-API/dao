## About You
[dOrg](https://dorg.tech) is a full stack Web3 development collective. It's been building custom DApps, DAOs, DeFi products, and developer tools in the Web3 space for a couple years now, working with some of Web3's top protocols.

[Ben Walker](https://t.me/benefacto19) will be the point of contact for this roadmap.

### Accountability

dOrg utilizes the following processes to keep all parties accountable in the course of execution.
- *Points of Contact* are responsible for keeping the project on track and should be interfaced through for any issues regarding scope, roadmap, quality, payments, etc.
- *Regular Syncs* to share updates, discuss blockers, and realign priorities.
- *Discord Chat* for ongoing updates and support
- *Github Project Board* for continuous deliverable tracking

### Code Quality

To ensure that we deliver quality code that satisfies project requirements without issue, dOrg:
- Carefully assigns proven builders with the relevant expertise
- Utilizes modern testing frameworks and testnet lifecycle simulation
- Performs internal code reviews before handoff and other key milestones

Despite these efforts, we are not able guarantee that all of our code will be perfect. Web3 is still an emerging field with a high level of risk and complexity. dOrg is not responsible for any bugs or technical failures that may result from our services. It is the Client's responsibility to consult with relevant security experts before taking high risk systems live.
