## Summary

This is a proposal for Web3Hub development, in which we will design and build out the interface according to the Product Roadmap document seen [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s8ZJaJZRfDYqjUFRXcB4egwrZQHIUqod9JhIws1g77Q/edit?usp=sharing). Starting in April we'll move to a 3-month proposal with monthly deliverable submissions.

The team composition will be the following for February:
- FT Engineer (Jeff)
- PT PM (Andrew)

Project management will be facilitated through Linear, day-to-day conversations will happen on the Web3API discord, and Andrew will lead the weekly sync meetings to give updates on overall project progress.


## Deliverables

The high-level goals for March are:
- v0.5 UI design 100% completed and Figma files delivered
- 95% polished interface according to the UI design, including animations
- Basic Create API integration that enables core devs to create and publish new APIs
- Spec completed for centralized backend services that enable user sign and publishing to the Web3Hub API index
