## Summary

Here is my proposal for the Developer Relations Engineer role.  My initial
activities will be to understand the launch partner (LP) program's priorities,
workflow, and team.  I'll do this by attending LP program meetings, talking to
our developers, and familiarizing myself with the monorepo codebase.

I'll iterate upon the existing technical documentation by adding further
instructions and flow diagrams. Also, I will write a repeatable script or
outline for LP presentations, with flexibility for individual LP concerns.

My proposal also includes coding activities such as frontend development of the
demo to better showcase Web3API's capabilities during presentations.

## About You

Co-creator of Reactime, a dev tool that assists React developers in analyzing UI
performance.  In building new features for Reactime, I reached out to the React
community and had 1-on-1s with devs to understand their painpoints and what
they'd like to see in a new dev tool.  I am interested in bringing my
engineering and dev relations experience to Web3API.
