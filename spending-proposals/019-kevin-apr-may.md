| Funds Requested     | Time Period                   | Estimated Effort | Effective Rate          |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| $16,000 + 48`W3API` | April 1, 2021 to May 31, 2021 | 320 Hours        | $50/hr + 0.15`W3API`/hr |

## Summary

Here is my proposal for the Developer Relations Engineer role.

In my first 2 weeks in Web3API, Jordan and I have written the new documentation found [here](https://documentation-master.on.fleek.co/). I've also met the LPs and studied the codebase.

In April, we will be at a point where we can assist LPs in building their own Web3APIs. An important milestone here is onboarding some of the LPs and understanding their painpoints when building a Web3API.

April and May also includes an important milestone which I'll play a role in: the Uniswap Web3API project. In this project, I'll be creating a presentation package (demo, documentation, etc.), meeting with our dev team, and working alongside the Uniswap team where needed.

See below for details on what I will deliver in regards to these milestones and more.

## About You

Co-creator of Reactime, a dev tool that assists React developers in analyzing UI performance. In building new features for Reactime, I reached out to the React
community and had 1-on-1s with devs to understand their painpoints and what they'd like to see in a new dev tool. I am interested in bringing my engineering and dev relations experience to Web3API.
