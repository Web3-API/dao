## Summary

In April 2021, I expanded my developer relations engineer role to also work on DAO operations work.

In May 2021, the highlights were meeting with about 6 launch partners to onboard them into building Web3APIs, signing on two new LPs (Chainstack / Enya-OMG Network), and nearing the completion of the Uniswap V2 Web3API demo.  In between, also worked on various Operations tasks such as reviewing dev-mining files, discussing DAO migration, rebranding, onboarding Leif, etc.

## April 2021 Updates

See below for my progress updates as of April 30, 2021:

### From my original April 2021 proposal
**Documentation**
- Completed pre-alpha documentation for the following, with the help of @dOrgjelli:
  - [Creating a dApp that uses Web3API](https://docs.web3api.dev/developers/create-js-dapp)
  - [Creating a JS Plugin](https://docs.web3api.dev/developers/create-js-plugin)
  - [Creating a Web3API](https://docs.web3api.dev/developers/create-as-web3api)

**Support Launch Partners Building their Web3APIs**
- Sent documentation to **16** of the current LPs for them to start building their own Web3APIs.
  - **Gnosis** has reviewed the Documentation for creating a Web3API and integrating into dApps.

**Uniswap Project**
- Weekly standups with our core dev team to provide updates on anything Uniswap-related (documentation, blockers, bugs, etc.).

### Additions to my original April 2021 proposal:
**Operating Model**
- Built operating model that includes monthly budget, financial projection, tokenholder data, LP token reward system, and more.
  - This model is still under construction and will be shared when it's ready.  For now, I've attached a screenshot of the model showing all proposals submitted to the DAO repo.

**Demos**
- Worked with @dOrgjelli to create the [Web3API demos](https://github.com/Web3-API/demos/).

**Uniswap**
- Began documentation for the Uniswap v2 Web3API.  See [pull request #10](https://github.com/Web3-API/documentation/pull/10).
  - Spent some time researching GraphQL docs automation, but ended up hand-authoring the docs because of technical issues. 
- Worked with a few other DAO members on the Uniswap Medium Article.
- With the help of other engineers, worked on a demo that integrates Web3API into the Uniswap v2 Interface.  See progress [here](https://github.com/web3-api/uniswap-interface).

**Operations Research**
- Researched operations and treasury functions of other DAOs.
- Worked on updated builder proposal flow.  See potential new proposal flow on this [TypeForm](https://web3api.typeform.com/to/rLPwMK2D).
- Submit Snapshot proposals for incentives for Launch Partners and Builders to review our docs.  See the [Snapshot proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/web3-api/proposal/QmY3DnFrMQPixREA68PiAnEHTLN7AL9Tx5qHB5Z6x6TuJf).
- Create Notion to record meeting notes for rebranding, operations, and dev syncs.

**Rebranding**
- Discussed rebranding strategies with Communications team.

**Recruiting**
- Reached out to candidates for the Rust developer position, and work with an engineering team to search for developer.

### Additions to May 2021 proposal:

**Launch Partner**
- Continue to message our LPs to complete the feedback form and look at our documentation.
- Met with ~6-7 launch partners to onboard them in building their Web3API.  Met with Gnosis where Jordan worked on a sample Gnosis Web3API.
- - Each meeting was an hour each and consisted of talking about Web3API, and showing the work we've done with Uniswap v2 Web3API
- Met and signed on launch partners: Chainstack, Enya/OMG Network

**Documentation**
- I would like to make the documentation more complete and professional.
- - Break the documentation guides into easier-to-follow parts, instead of one long guide.
- Walked thru documentation in detail with Roberto
- Write documentation for [Web3API tooling](https://docs.web3api.dev/devtools/web3api-cli).
- - Completed docs for `cli`, `client-js` and `react`.

**Uniswap**

## Incomplete work to roll over to June 2021

  -  WebAssembly, and the languages that compile to it (AssemblyScript, Rust, Go, etc.).
  -  Introduction to GraphQL as it relates to Web3API.
- Update the current proposal process.
- Write specification using [Spec Markdown](https://spec-md.com/), or similiar tool.


## Fund Distribution

Distribution of funds of all stable coins and W3API tokens should be sent to Kevin Ngo's address @ `0x937F5b32Bc3cafcd1B02462F93e6AE5a843f6C6A`.

## About Me

My background is in developer relations, operations, and software development, and before Web3API DAO, I contributed to Reactime, a developer tool to analyze UI performance in React apps.  When I'm not working, I like pixel art, video games, and anime.
