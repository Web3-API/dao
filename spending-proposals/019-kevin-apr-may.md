## April 2021 Updates

See below for my progress updates as of April 30, 2021:

### From my original April 2021 proposal
**Documentation**
- Completed pre-alpha documentation for the following, with the help of @dOrgjelli:
  - [Creating a dApp that uses Web3API](https://docs.web3api.dev/developers/create-js-dapp)
  - [Creating a JS Plugin](https://docs.web3api.dev/developers/create-js-plugin)
  - [Creating a Web3API](https://docs.web3api.dev/developers/create-as-web3api)

**Support Launch Partners Building their Web3APIs**
- Sent documentation to **16** of the current LPs for them to start building their own Web3APIs.
  - **Gnosis** has reviewed the Documentation for creating a Web3API and integrating into dApps.

**Uniswap Project**
- Weekly standups with our core dev team to provide updates on anything Uniswap-related (documentation, blockers, bugs, etc.).

### Additions to my original April 2021 proposal:
**Operating Model**
- Built operating model that includes monthly budget, financial projection, tokenholder data, LP token reward system, and more.
  - This model is still under construction and will be shared when it's ready.  For now, I've attached a screenshot of the model showing all proposals submitted to the DAO repo.

**Demos**
- Worked with @dOrgjelli to create the [Web3API demos](https://github.com/Web3-API/demos/).

**Uniswap**
- Began documentation for the Uniswap v2 Web3API.  See [pull request #10](https://github.com/Web3-API/documentation/pull/10).
  - Spent some time researching GraphQL docs automation, but ended up hand-authoring the docs because of technical issues. 
- Worked with a few other DAO members on the Uniswap Medium Article.
- With the help of other engineers, worked on a demo that integrates Web3API into the Uniswap v2 Interface.  See progress [here](https://github.com/web3-api/uniswap-interface).

**Operations Research**
- Researched operations and treasury functions of other DAOs.
- Worked on updated builder proposal flow.  See potential new proposal flow on this [TypeForm](https://web3api.typeform.com/to/rLPwMK2D).
- Submit Snapshot proposals for incentives for Launch Partners and Builders to review our docs.  See the [Snapshot proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/web3-api/proposal/QmY3DnFrMQPixREA68PiAnEHTLN7AL9Tx5qHB5Z6x6TuJf).
- Create Notion to record meeting notes for rebranding, operations, and dev syncs.

**Rebranding**
- Discussed rebranding strategies with Communications team.

**Recruiting**
- Reached out to candidates for the Rust developer position, and work with an engineering team to search for developer.

### Incomplete work to roll over to May 2021:
- Write specification using [Spec Markdown](https://spec-md.com/), or similiar tool.
- Write documentation for [Web3API tooling](https://docs.web3api.dev/devtools/web3api-cli).

### Additions to May 2021 proposal:
**Web3API Academy**
- Create documentation for "pre-req" knowledge needed to fully understand Web3API:
  -  WebAssembly, and the languages that compile to it (AssemblyScript, Rust, Go, etc.).
  -  Introduction to GraphQL as it relates to Web3API.

**Launch Partner**
- Write a mission documentation to clearly outline the goals of the LP program.
- Continue to message our LPs to complete the feedback form and look at our documentation.

**Documentation**
- I would like to make the documentation more complete and professional.
  - Add a "Tutorial" section, meant for newbies to use Web3APIs in their dApps for hackathons.  Inspired by [Hardhat's Tutorial](https://hardhat.org/tutorial/).

**Uniswap**
- Continue working on Uniswap dApp demo.
- Complete Uniswap v2 Web3API documentation.

**Operations**
- Complete the operating model and make sure that it is easy to use and understand for our DAO members.
- Update the current proposal process.

## About Me

My background is in developer relations, operations, and software development, and before Web3API DAO, I contributed to Reactime, a developer tool to analyze UI performance in React apps.  When I'm not working, I like pixel art, video games, and anime.  I'm collaborating with a pixel artist from the UK to make an NFT art collection.
