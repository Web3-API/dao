The `Web3API` token holders, known collectively as the "DAO", are responsible for stewarding the Web3API ecosystem. The DAO controls the:
- Treasury
- Token minting
- DAO configuration
- ENS domain (web3api.eth)

In the future, it is anticipated that the DAO will also govern:
- Web3API repositories
- Web3Hub platform deployments
- DAO-verified APIs (hosted at web3api.eth subdomains)

### Q1 2021 Compensation Guidelines

Here are some guidelines for making your spending proposals. These guidelines are just guidelines, as all final decisions are made by the DAO.

|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Junior | 0-2| 0.05 `W3API`, $50 | 0.125 `W3API`, $35 | 0.225 `W3API`, $20 | 0.375 `W3API`, $0 |
| Intermediate | 2-4 | 0.06 `W3API`, $65 | 0.15 `W3API`, $50 | 0.27 `W3API`, $35 | 0.45 `W3API`, $0 |
| Senior | 4+ | 0.07 `W3API`, $80 | 0.175 `W3API`, $65 | 0.315 `W3API`, $50| 0.525 `W3API`, $0 |

## Legal

Holders of `W3API` do not constitute any sort of partnership or joint venture, only the right to participate in the governance of the DAO. Further, becoming a Builder does not constitute any sort of partnership, joint venture, principal-agent relationship, or an employer-employee relationship.
